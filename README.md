# Weather-Forecasting
Developed a machine learning model for weather forecasting over 100 years from 1920 - 2020,  utilizing Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Tenser-Flow, to predict temperature,  humidity, and precipitation with high accuracy.  
Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering on historical weather data, improving 
model performance by 80% and ensuring the reliability of prediction.
